Unfuck youtube searches

Adds `&sp=CAASAhAB` to the end of youtube search urls, which removes such fields as "people also watched" and "recommended for you"

Todo:
- [ ] (Potentially?) add multilingual support
- [ ] Intercept the page load and add the parameter before the search to make it faster (I don't know how to do this but PRs are welcome.)
